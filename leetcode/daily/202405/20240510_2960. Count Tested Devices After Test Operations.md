# [2960. Count Tested Devices After Test Operations](https://leetcode.cn/problems/count-tested-devices-after-test-operations/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-10)



## Problem Explanation
Assume the total tested deivces is ans.   
We tested the devices in order from 0 to n - 1.

If we tested this devices the ans need to add one.And the devices which after this device need to -1.
> We have tested the x devices, the next device need to -x

If now is the j<sup>th</sup> device, we have tested x devices before. The battery is Math.max(0, batteryPercentages[j] - x).
The x is the ans now.

## Code

### python
```python
class Solution:
    def countTestedDevices(self, batteryPercentages: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        n = len(batteryPercentages)
        for battery in batteryPercentages:
            ans += 1 if battery > ans else 0
        return ans

```

### TypeScript
```TypeScript

function countTestedDevices(batteryPercentages: number[]): number {
    let ans: number = 0;
    for (let battery of batteryPercentages) {
        ans += battery > ans ? 1 : 0;
    }
    return ans;
};
```
