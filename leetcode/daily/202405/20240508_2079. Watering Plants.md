# [2079. Watering Plants](https://leetcode.cn/problems/watering-plants/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-08)



## Problem Explanation
We can simulate the process.
Assume we at the x.
+ If the can is not enough to watering the next plant, we need x - (-1) steps to refill the water.
And we need x + 1 - (-1) steps to get the next plant and water it. The can will be refill and used so the value is capacity - plant[i].

+ If the can is enough we could move 1 step to the next plant and  watering the plant. The can's value will be can - plants[i]

```python
class Solution:
    def wateringPlants(self, plants: List[int], capacity: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        can = capacity
        fillx = -1
        for x, plant in enumerate(plants):
            if plant <= can:
                ans += 1
                can -= plant
            else:
                # fill the can
                ans += x - 1 - fillx
                # arrive to the x 
                ans += x - fillx
                can = capacity - plant
        return ans
```

### TypeScript
```TypeScript
function wateringPlants(plants: number[], capacity: number): number {
    let ans = 0;
    let can = capacity;
    let fillx = -1;
    for (let i = 0; i < plants.length; i++) {
        if (can < plants[i]) {
            ans += i - 1 - fillx;
            ans += i - fillx
            can = capacity - plants[i];
        } else {
            ans += 1
            can -= plants[i];
        }
    }
    return ans;
};
