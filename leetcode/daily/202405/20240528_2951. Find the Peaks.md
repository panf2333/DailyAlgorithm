# [2951. Find the Peaks](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-the-peaks/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-28)



## Problem Explanation
Due to the first and last element is not the peak. We only need to iterate the [1, mountain.length - 1]. The peak only consist in this range.

Each i in the range we compare mountain[i] to mountain[i - 1] and mountain[i + 1]. If the mountain[i] is the maximum number. We add this to the answer.

### Time complex:
O(n)
### Space complex:
O(n) 
Maybe we have n/2 peaks.
## Code

### python
```python
class Solution:
    def findPeaks(self, mountain: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        peaks = [i for i in range(1, len(mountain) - 1) if mountain[i] > mountain[i - 1] and mountain[i] > mountain[i + 1]]
        return peaks
        

```

### TypeScript
```TypeScript
function findPeaks(mountain: number[]): number[] {
    let peaks: number[] = [];
    for (let i = 1; i < mountain.length - 1; i++) {
        if (mountain[i] > mountain[i - 1] && mountain[i] > mountain[i + 1]) {
            peaks.push(i);
        }
    }
    return peaks;
};

```
