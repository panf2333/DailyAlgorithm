# [1953. Maximum Number of Weeks for Which You Can Work](https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximum-number-of-weeks-for-which-you-can-work/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-16)



## Problem Explanation
https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximum-number-of-weeks-for-which-you-can-work/solutions/2779207/tan-xin-ju-ti-gou-zao-fang-an-pythonjava-3xyq/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-16

We sum the milestones and get the maximum.

If maximum > sum - maximum, we can't finished all of the projects.    
We will violate the rule two.    
In this case we just return the (sum - maximum) * 2 + 1. 
[max, other, max, other,...other, max].  
> (max: maximum, other: sum - maximum)


Else maximum <= sum - maximum, we can finish all the milestones.
+ We can sort the array. 
+ Then put the maximum element to the even position first.
+ If the maximum element is used out. We put the second maximum element.
> This can ensure the element will not be consecutive.
+ Then we put the remain elements to fill out the odd position.
> only when element put on the even index and odd index can be adjacent.  
> But the first element is the longest sequence. The next element can't be longer then the before.

><font color="red">This example can also indicate that the maximum count of the element can not be greater than length / 2 + 1.
If this will become [a,-,a,-,a] -> [a,a,a,-,a]
</font>


[a,-,a,-,a,-,a,-,b,-,b]  
[a,b,a,-,a,-,a,-,b,-,b]   
[a,b,a,c,a,c,a,-,b,-,b]   
[a,b,a,c,a,c,a,d,b,d,b]

## Code

### python
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfWeeks(self, milestones: List[int]) -> int:
        sumnum = sum(milestones)
        maximum = max(milestones)
        ans = 0
        if maximum > sumnum - maximum:
            return 1 + ((sumnum - maximum) << 1)
        else:
            return sumnum 
```

### TypeScript
```TypeScript
function numberOfWeeks(milestones: number[]): number {
    let sum = 0;
    let max = 0;
    for (let milestone of milestones) {
        sum += milestone;
        max = Math.max(max, milestone);
    }
    return max > sum - max ? ((sum - max) << 1) + 1 : sum;
};

```
