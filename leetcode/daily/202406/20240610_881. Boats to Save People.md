# [881. Boats to Save People](https://leetcode.cn/problems/boats-to-save-people/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-10)



## Problem Explanation
Two pointer.

We sorted the people array first. Then we got an array with the weight from thin to heavy.

The heaviest people match with the thinest people. If they can pair, we move to next both. If not, we just move save the heaviest people.

Because the thiner people maybe get paired with the other people.

## Code

### python
```python
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people = sorted(people)
        ans, left, right = 0, 0, len(people) - 1
        while left <= right:
            if people[left] + people[right] <= limit:
                ans += 1
                left += 1
                right -= 1
            else:
                ans += 1
                right -= 1
        # print(ans, left, right)
        return ans
```

### TypeScript
```TypeScript
function numRescueBoats(people: number[], limit: number): number {
    let ans = 0;
    let left = 0;
    let right = people.length - 1;
    people.sort((a, b) => Number(a) - Number(b))
    while (left <= right) {
        if (people[left] + people[right] <= limit) {
            left++;
            right--;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
        ans += 1;
    }
    return ans;
};
