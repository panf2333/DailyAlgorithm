# [2923. Find Champion I](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-champion-i/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-12)



## Problem Explanation
+ grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
+ For all i grid[i][i] is 0.
+ For all i, j that i != j, grid[i][j] != grid[j][i].
+ The input is generated such that if team a is stronger than team b and team b is stronger than team c, then team a is stronger than team c.

These constraint are mean the input data always be vaild.

So, If the team is champion, it will stronger than others. We just need to summary the grid[i]. If the sumi equals n - 1. The i team is the champoin.


Assume the team number is n
### Time complex:
O(n^2)
We need to summary all of the matrix in the worst situation.

### Space complex:
O(1)
We don't need other space

## Code

### python
```python
    # The input is generated such that if team a is stronger than team b and team b is stronger than team c, then team a is stronger than team c.
    # For all i grid[i][i] is 0.
    # It is means that the input data is vaild. So we just summary the grid[i] = sumi. If sumi is equals to n - 1. It's stronger than others. 
    def findChampion(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        for i, row in enumerate(grid):
            if sum(row) == n - 1:
                return i
        return -1
        
```

### TypeScript
```TypeScript
function findChampion(grid: number[][]): number {
    let n = grid.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let sum = 0;
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) sum += grid[i][j];
        if (sum == n - 1) return i;
    }
    return -1;
};

```
