# [3153. Sum of Digit Differences of All Pairs](https://leetcode.cn/problems/sum-of-digit-differences-of-all-pairs/description/)



## Problem Explanation
We Counter each digit in same position. Then we will get a len = 10 array arr.  
arr[i][j] = k indicate the position i has the k number of digit j. 
We calculate the difference by k * (sum(arr[i]) - k) in the row. We assume the sum in this row is rowDifference sm - k is the number of digit that different with j.

We should sum(rowDifference) // 2 because every pair will calculate twice. 
### Time complex:
n is the len(nums)
m is the len(nums[0])
O(n * m)
### Space complex:
O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def sumDigitDifferences(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        arr = [[0] * 10 for _ in range(15)]
        for x in nums:
            i = 0
            while x > 0:
                arr[i][x % 10] += 1
                x //= 10
                i += 1
        ans = 0
        # print(arr)
        for row in arr:
            sm = sum(row)
            tmp = 0
            for x in row:
                tmp += x * (sm - x)
            # every pair will calculate twice
            ans += tmp // 2
        return ans
