# [2332. The Latest Time to Catch a Bus](https://leetcode.cn/problems/the-latest-time-to-catch-a-bus/description/)

## Problem Explanation
We sort the buses and passengers first.

Then we simulate the process of passenger arrive and the bus leave. We use two point the simulate this.

1. If the last bus is not full, we assume the use will arrive at bus[-1]. 
2. Otherwise will arrive passengers[last]. Because we should replace the last passangers.
2.1 We search from the end to the start to find the lastest time which passenger will not arrive. This is we need to arrive

        ind -= 1
        ans = buses[-1] if cnt else passengers[ind]
