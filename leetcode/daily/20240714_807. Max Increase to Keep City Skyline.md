# [807. Max Increase to Keep City Skyline.md](https://leetcode.cn/problems/max-increase-to-keep-city-skyline/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-14)



## Problem Explanation
We deal the data to get the max number of the row and col.

To keep the skyline no change in any direction, we can't increase the grid[i][j] hight exceed the min(row[i], col[j])

### Time complex:
O(n^2)
### Space complex:
O(2n)
## Code

### python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        row = [max(r) for r in grid]
        col = [0] * n
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                col[j] = max(col[j], grid[i][j])
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                ans += min(row[i], col[j]) - grid[i][j]
        return ans
