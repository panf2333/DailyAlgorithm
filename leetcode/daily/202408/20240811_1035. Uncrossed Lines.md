# [1035. Uncrossed Lines](https://leetcode.cn/problems/uncrossed-lines/description/)



## Problem Explanation
We define the dp[i + 1][j + 1] is the maximum lines between nums1[:i + 1] and nums2[:j + 1].

1. if nums1[i] == nums2[j], we can draw a line between them. dp[i][j] + 1. And compare to dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i][j + 1].
> we can also omit this, because dp[i + 1][j] is less than or equals dp[i][j]. The dp[i][j] is the maximum lines before. We can only replace the final line by connecting nums1[i] and nums2[x] (x < j.)    
dp[i][j + 1] is the same reason.

2. if nums1[i] != nums2[j], we can't draw a new line between i,j we only choose in the dp[i][j], dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j + 1]
> dp[i][j + 1] is less than or equals dp[i][j] (replace last line)
