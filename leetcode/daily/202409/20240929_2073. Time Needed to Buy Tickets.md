# [2073. Time Needed to Buy Tickets](https://leetcode.cn/problems/time-needed-to-buy-tickets/description/)

## Problem Explanation
The person i before k, need to buy min(tickets[k], tickets[i]). (If tickets[i] < tickets[k] they only buy ti and then exit the queue, otherwise they will buy tickets[k] ticktes until the person k exit the line.)  

The person j after k, need to buy min(tickets[k] - 1, tickets[j]). Because the person k already buy a ticket. (beacuse tickets[i] >= 1, we will not get negative)
