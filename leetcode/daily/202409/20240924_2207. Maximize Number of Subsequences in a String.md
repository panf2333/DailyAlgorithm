# [2207. Maximize Number of Subsequences in a String](https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximize-number-of-subsequences-in-a-string/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-24)

## Problem Explanation
We use acnt to record the pattern[0] occur times before, and bcnt record pattern[1].

If text[i] equals pattern[1], we can get acnt new subsequence.

In the end, we can insert pattern[0] before all character match pattern[1] to get the maximum subsequence (count is bcnt).
Also we can insert pattern[1] after all character match pattern[0] get acnt new subsequence.

ans + max(acnt, bcnt)

class Solution:
    def maximumSubsequenceCount(self, text: str, pattern: str) -> int:
        ans, acnt, bcnt = 0, 0, 0
        for c in text:
            if c == pattern[1]:
                ans += acnt
                bcnt += 1
            if c == pattern[0]:
                acnt += 1
        
        return ans + max(acnt, bcnt)
