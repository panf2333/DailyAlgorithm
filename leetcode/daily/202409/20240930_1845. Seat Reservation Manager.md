# [1845. Seat Reservation Manager](https://leetcode.cn/problems/seat-reservation-manager/description/)

## Problem Explanation
We use a minimum heap to resolve this problem.
### Time complex:
O(invokeCnt * log n)
### Space complex:
O(n)
## Code

### python
```python
class SeatManager:

    def __init__(self, n: int):
        # 创建一个空堆
        heap = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            heapq.heappush(heap, i)
        self.heap = heap

    def reserve(self) -> int:
        return heapq.heappop(self.heap)

    def unreserve(self, seatNumber: int) -> None:
        heapq.heappush(self.heap, seatNumber)


# Your SeatManager object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = SeatManager(n)
# param_1 = obj.reserve()
# obj.unreserve(seatNumber)
```
