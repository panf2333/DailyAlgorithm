# [2848. Points That Intersect With Cars](https://leetcode.cn/problems/points-that-intersect-with-cars/)

## Problem Explanation
We use an array to record the change of the car. ans[start] += 1, ans[end + 1] -= 1.  
Then sum the array, so the i<sup>th</sup> element is the index has been cover by how many cars.

Finally we count the arrary[i] > 0

        for s, e in nums:
            ans[s] += 1
            ans[e + 1] -= 1

        cnt = 0
        for i in range(1, len(ans)):
            ans[i] += ans[i - 1]
            if ans[i] > 0:
                cnt += 1
        return cnt
