# [2739. Total Distance Traveled](https://leetcode.cn/problems/total-distance-traveled/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-25)



## Problem Explanation
We just simulate this progress.
When mainTank is greater than or equals 5.
We add 50 km and reduce the 5 liters.

If the additionalTank is greater than 1 liter. We transfer the fuel to the mainTank.

If mainTank is less than 5. We can't transfer again. Then we just used up the fuel in the mainTank.

### Time complex:
O(1)

1 <= mainTank, additionalTank <= 100
100/5=20
20/5 = 4

### Space complex:
O(1)
## Code

### python
```python
class Solution:
    def distanceTraveled(self, mainTank: int, additionalTank: int) -> int:
        distance = 0
        while mainTank >= 5:
            distance += 5 * 10
            mainTank -= 5
            if additionalTank > 0:
                additionalTank -= 1
                mainTank += 1
        distance += mainTank * 10
        return distance
```

### TypeScript
```TypeScript

function distanceTraveled(mainTank: number, additionalTank: number): number {
    let distance = 0;
    while (mainTank >= 5) {
        distance += 50;
        mainTank -= 5;
        if (additionalTank > 0){
            additionalTank--;
            mainTank++;
        }
    }
    return distance + mainTank * 10;
};
```
