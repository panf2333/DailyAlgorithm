# [3258. Count Substrings That Satisfy K-Constraint I](https://leetcode.cn/problems/count-substrings-that-satisfy-k-constraint-i/description/)

## Problem Explanation
We use [left, right] to denote the range of s. And zc is the number of the '0' in the range, oc is the number of the '1' in the range.  
If zc <= k or oc <= k, we only increase the zc or oc.   
If zc > k and oc > k the constraint is broke, we move the left point to let the zc and oc satisfy the K-Constraint. The cnt will increase by right - left. Because the [left, right) is not satisfy but the [left, right - 1] is satisfy so right - 1 - left + 1 = right - left.

Finally we will get a range [left, n - 1] all of the pair is the valid substring. 

1, 2, 3, 4..., n - 1 - left + 1, we use the sum formula for arithmetic sequence to get the answer by O(1)

    def countKConstraintSubstrings(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        cnt, left, right = 0, 0, 0
        zc, oc = 0, 0
        n = len(s)
        while right < n:
            if s[right] == '0':
                zc += 1
            else:
                oc += 1
            while zc > k and oc > k:
                # [left, right) right is not satisfy
                cnt += right - left
                if s[left] == '0':
                    zc -= 1
                else:
                    oc -= 1
                left += 1
            right += 1
        # [left, n - 1] all satisfy
        # n - 1 - left + 1,   n - 1 - (left + 1) + 1...  , n - 1 - (n - 1) + 1=1
        # [left, n - 1], [left + 1, n - 1]...[n - 1, n - 1]
        cnt += (1 + n - 1 - left + 1) * (n - 1 - left + 1) // 2
        return  cnt
