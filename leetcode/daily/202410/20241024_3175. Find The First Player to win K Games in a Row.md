# [3175. Find The First Player to win K Games in a Row](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-the-first-player-to-win-k-games-in-a-row/description/)

## Problem Explanation
We compare every pair until the skills end. If we find someone can win k games return it.

After one loop, the max(skills) will always in the first position and win others until win k times. So, if we can't find the winner in the loop, we can return the maximum directly.

            if skills[ind] > skills[i]:
                wincnt += 1
            else:
                wincnt = 1

                return ind
        return ind
