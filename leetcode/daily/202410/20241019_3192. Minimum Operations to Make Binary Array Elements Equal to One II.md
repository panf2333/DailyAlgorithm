# [3192. Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One II](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-binary-array-elements-equal-to-one-ii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-19)

## Problem Explanation
Assume the final operations array is [2,3,5,7,6].

This is equivalent to operation with [2,3,5,6,7], all of the operation will effect the [i, end].

So we consider from [0, end]. We can record the flip_cnt.
1. when the origin number is 1 and flip_cnt is odd, this position is 0, we need to flip it.
2. when the origin number is 0 and flip_cnt is even, this position is 0, we need to flip it.

### python
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        flip_cnt = 0
        for x in nums:
            if x == 1 and flip_cnt & 1 == 1:
                flip_cnt += 1
            if x == 0 and flip_cnt & 1 == 0:
                flip_cnt += 1
        return flip_cnt
